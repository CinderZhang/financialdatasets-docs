### Overview
You can use our data to power your AI financial agents, portfolio management tools,
stock analysis dashboards, quantitative trading algorithms, and more.

We have data for <b>15,000+</b> public companies, going back <b>30+</b> years.

You are welcome to save any data that you receive from our API.  Our platform is built by developers for developers.

### Getting Started
We are currently in beta mode and will launch later in July 2024.

You can join our waitlist by signing up at [financialdatasets.ai](https://financialdatasets.ai).  Developers who are on the waitlist
will get first access to our API when we launch.

In the meantime, we have created a free tier for developers to test out our API.  We have outlined a few code examples below to get you started.

### Code Examples
In the beta, you can access financials for 10 companies:

```python
['AAPL', 'MSFT', 'BRK.B', 'NVDA', 'AMZN', 'META', 'LLY', 'AVGO', 'TSLA', 'GOOGL']
```
<CodeGroup>

```python GET Income Statements
import requests

ticker = 'NVDA'     # stock ticker
period = 'annual'   # possible values are 'annual', 'quarterly', or 'ttm'
limit = 10          # number of statements to return
url = f'https://api.financialdatasets.ai/financials/income-statements?ticker={ticker}&period={period}&limit={limit}'

# make API request
response = requests.get(url)

# grab income_statements
income_statements = response.json().get('income_statements')
```

```python GET Balance Sheets
import requests

ticker = 'NVDA'     # stock ticker
period = 'annual'   # possible values are 'annual', 'quarterly', or 'ttm'
limit = 10          # number of statements to return
url = f'https://api.financialdatasets.ai/financials/balance-sheets?ticker={ticker}&period={period}&limit={limit}'

# make API request
response = requests.get(url)

# grab balance_sheets
balance_sheets = response.json().get('balance_sheets')
```

```python GET Cash Flow Statements
import requests

ticker = 'NVDA'     # stock ticker
period = 'annual'   # possible values are 'annual', 'quarterly', or 'ttm'
limit = 10          # number of statements to return
url = f'https://api.financialdatasets.ai/financials/cash-flow-statements?ticker={ticker}&period={period}&limit={limit}'

# make API request
response = requests.get(url)

# grab cash_flow_statements
cash_flow_statements = response.json().get('cash_flow_statements')
```
