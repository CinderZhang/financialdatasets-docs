You will use the API key to authenticate your API requests.

### ðŸ“Š Available CIKs
You can fetch a list of available CIKs with a `GET` request to:
https://api.financialdatasets.ai/filings/ciks/

###  ðŸš€  Getting Started
There are only 3 steps for making a successful API call:
1. Add your API key to the header of the request as `X-API-KEY`.
2. Add query params like `cik` to filter the data.
3. Execute the API request.

**Note**: You must include either the `cik` in your query params.

### ðŸ’»  Example

```python Filings
import requests

# add your API key to the headers
headers = {
    "X-API-KEY": "your_api_key_here"
}

# set your query params
cik = '0000320193'

# create the URL
url = (
    f'https://api.financialdatasets.ai/filings'
    f'?cik={cik}'
)

# make API request
response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)

# parse filings from the response
filings = response.json().get('filings')
```
