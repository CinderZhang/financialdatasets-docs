title: 'Search (by filters)'

openapi: 'POST /financials/search'
---

### ðŸ‘‹  Overview
This endpoint lets you search for companies based on a set of `filters` that you specify. You can filter by any financial metric that is listed below in the [Filters](#filters) section.

For example, you can search for companies with revenue greater than \$100 million and capital expenditure less than \$10 million and receive the following response:

```json
{
  "search_results": [
    {
      "ticker": "ORCL",
      "report_period": "2024-08-31",
      "period": "ttm",
      "revenue": 53815000000,
      "capital_expenditure": -7855000000
    },
    {
      "ticker": "PLAY",
      "report_period": "2024-08-06",
      "period": "ttm",
      "revenue": 2211100000,
      "capital_expenditure": -424400000
    }
  ]
}
```


To get started, please create an account and grab your <b>API key</b> at [financialdatasets.ai](https://financialdatasets.ai).

You will use the API key to authenticate your API requests.

The Financials Search API lets you search for financial data across income statements, balance sheets,
and cash flow statements for <b>16,000+</b> public companies, going back <b>30+</b> years.

###  ðŸš€  Getting Started
There are 3 steps for making a successful API call:
1. Add your API key to the header of the request as `X-API-KEY`.
2. Prepare a JSON body with your search criteria, including `period`, `limit`, and `filters`.
3. Execute the API request to the /financials/search endpoint using a POST method.

Note: `filters` is required. By default, `period` is `"ttm"` and `limit` is 100.

### ðŸ”Ž  Filters
You can filter the search results by adding one or more `filters`.

You may specify multiple `filters` to narrow down the search results.

We charge \$0.01 per 10 filters per search. For example, 5 filters costs \$0.01, 15 filters costs \$0.02, and so on.

Each filter consists of a `field`, an `operator`, and a `value`.

The `operator` must be one of:
- `"eq"` (equal to)
- `"gt"` (greater than)
- `"gte"` (greater than or equal to)
- `"lt"` (less than)
- `"lte"` (less than or equal to)

The `value` must be a number like `1000000`.

The `field` must be one of the following from the income statement, balance sheet, or cash flow statement:

# Create the URL
url = 'https://api.financialdatasets.ai/financials/search'

# Make API request
response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, data=json.dumps(body))

# Parse search results from the response
search_results = response.json().get('search_results')

# Print the results
for result in search_results:
    print(f"Ticker: {result['ticker']}")
    print(f"Report Period: {result['report_period']}")
