### ðŸ‘‹  Overview
The Crypto Snapshot API lets you pull the latest real-time price for a given cryptocurrency.

The real-time price is the last price that was traded for the ticker on exchanges like Coinbase, Kraken, and Bitfinex.

To get started, please create an account and grab your <b>API key</b> at [financialdatasets.ai](https://financialdatasets.ai).

You will use the API key to authenticate your API requests.

### ðŸ“Š Available Tickers
You can fetch a list of available tickers with a `GET` request to:
https://api.financialdatasets.ai/crypto/prices/tickers/

###  ðŸš€  Getting Started
There are only 3 steps for making a successful API call:
1. Add your API key to the header of the request as `X-API-KEY`.
2. Add query params like `ticker` to filter the data.
3. Execute the API request.

**Note**: You must provide the `ticker`.

### ðŸ’»  Example

```python Price Snapshot
import requests

# add your API key to the headers
headers = {
    "X-API-KEY": "your_api_key_here"
}

# set your query params
ticker = 'BTC-USD'

# create the URL
url = (
    f'https://api.financialdatasets.ai/crypto/prices/snapshot'
    f'?ticker={ticker}'
)

# make API request
response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)

# parse snapshot from the response
snapshot = response.json().get('snapshot')
```
