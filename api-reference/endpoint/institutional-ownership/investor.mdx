### ðŸ‘‹  Overview
The institutional ownership API provides access to the equity holdings of investment managers overseeing $100M+ in assets. 

This quarterly data comes directly from Form 13F filings and includes tickers, share quantities, estimated holding prices, and market values.

You can use this data to:
- Track position changes of major hedge funds and asset managers
- Identify emerging sector rotations and market themes
- Build investment strategies based on institutional money flows
- Monitor industry concentration and portfolio overlap

Note: Form 13F filings have a 45-day lag from quarter end and only include long positions in SEC-registered securities.

Any data that you receive from our API is yours to keep. You may save the data to minimize repeat API calls.

To get started, please create an account and grab your <b>API key</b> at [financialdatasets.ai](https://financialdatasets.ai).

You will use the API key to authenticate your API requests.
