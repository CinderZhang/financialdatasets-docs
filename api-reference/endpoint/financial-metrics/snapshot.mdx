### ðŸ‘‹  Overview
We have real-time financial metrics for all actively traded equities in the US.

Any data that you receive from our API is yours to keep. You may save the data to minimize repeat API calls.

To get started, please create an account and grab your <b>API key</b> at [financialdatasets.ai](https://financialdatasets.ai).

You will use the API key to authenticate your API requests.

###  ðŸš€  Getting Started
There are only 3 steps for making a successful API call:
1. Add your API key to the header of the request as `X-API-KEY`.
2. Add query params like `ticker` to filter the data.
3. Execute the API request.

**Note**: You must provide the `ticker`.

### ðŸ’»  Example

```python Financial Metrics Snapshot
import requests

# add your API key to the headers
headers = {
    "X-API-KEY": "your_api_key_here"
}

# set your query params
ticker = 'AAPL'

# create the URL
url = (
    f'https://api.financialdatasets.ai/financial-metrics/snapshot'
    f'?ticker={ticker}'
)

# make API request
response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)

# parse snapshot from the response
snapshot = response.json().get('snapshot')
```
