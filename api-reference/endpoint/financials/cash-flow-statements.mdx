title: 'Cash Flow Statements'
openapi: 'GET /financials/cash-flow-statements'

### ðŸ‘‹  Overview
The cash flow statemenet API provides a company's cash inflows and outflows over a specific period.

Cash flow statements are divided into three sections: operating activities, investing activities, and financing activities.

You can filter the data by `ticker`, `period`, `limit`, and `cik`.

The `period` parameter can be set to `annual`, `quarterly`, or `ttm` (trailing twelve months). The `limit` parameter is used to specify the number of statements to return.

To get started, please create an account and grab your <b>API key</b> at [financialdatasets.ai](https://financialdatasets.ai).

You will use the API key to authenticate your API requests.

###  ðŸš€  Getting Started
There are only 3 steps for making a successful API call:
1. Add your API key to the header of the request as `X-API-KEY`.
2. Add query params like `ticker`, `period` and `limit` to filter the data.
3. Execute the API request.

**Note**: `ticker` and `period` are required. Alternatively, you can use `cik` instead of `ticker` as a company identifier in your request.  By default, `limit` is `10`.

### ðŸ’»  Example
```python Cash Flow Statements
import requests

# add your API key to the headers
headers = {
    "X-API-KEY": "your_api_key_here"
}

# set your query params
ticker = 'NVDA'     # stock ticker
period = 'annual'   # possible values are 'annual', 'quarterly', or 'ttm'
limit = 30          # number of statements to return

# create the URL
url = (
    f'https://api.financialdatasets.ai/financials/cash-flow-statements'
    f'?ticker={ticker}'
    f'&period={period}'
    f'&limit={limit}'
)

# make API request
response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)

# parse cash_flow_statements from the response
cash_flow_statements = response.json().get('cash_flow_statements')
```
