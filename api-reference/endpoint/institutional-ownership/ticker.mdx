title: 'Ownership (by ticker)'
openapi: 'GET /institutional-ownership'

### ðŸ‘‹  Overview
The institutional ownership API provides access to the equity holdings of investment managers overseeing $100M+ in assets. 

This quarterly data comes directly from Form 13F filings and includes tickers, share quantities, estimated holding prices, and market values.

When you query by ticker, the API returns the institutional owners of the specified ticker.

You can use this data to:
- Track the institutional owners of a ticker
- Identify emerging sector rotations and market themes
- Build investment strategies based on institutional money flows
- Monitor industry concentration and portfolio overlap

Note: Form 13F filings have a 45-day lag from quarter end and only include long positions in SEC-registered securities.

Any data that you receive from our API is yours to keep. You may save the data to minimize repeat API calls.

To get started, please create an account and grab your <b>API key</b> at [financialdatasets.ai](https://financialdatasets.ai).

You will use the API key to authenticate your API requests.

### ðŸ“Š Available Tickers
You can fetch a list of available tickers with a `GET` request to:
https://api.financialdatasets.ai/institutional-ownership/tickers/

###  ðŸš€  Getting Started
There are only 3 steps for making a successful API call:
1. Add your API key to the header of the request as `X-API-KEY`.
2. Add query params like `ticker` and `limit` to filter the data.
3. Execute the API request.

### ðŸ”Ž  Filtering the Data
You can filter the data by `ticker`, `limit`, and `report_period`.

**Note**: `ticker` is required required.  By default, `limit` is `10` and `report_period` is `null`.

The `limit` parameter is used to specify the number of periods to return.

The `report_period` parameter is used to specify the date of the holdings.  For example, you can include filters like `report_period_lte=2024-09-30` and `report_period_gte=2024-01-01` to get holdings between January 1, 2024 and September 30, 2024.

The available `report_period` operations are:
- `report_period_lte` 
- `report_period_lt`
- `report_period_gte`
- `report_period_gt`
- `report_period`


### ðŸ’»  Example

```python Institutional Ownership
import requests

# add your API key to the headers
headers = {
    "X-API-KEY": "your_api_key_here"
}

# set your query params
ticker = 'NVDA'     # ticker
limit = 100         # number of holdings to return

# create the URL
url = (
    f'https://api.financialdatasets.ai/institutional-ownership/'
    f'?ticker={ticker}'
    f'&limit={limit}'
)

# make API request
response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)

# parse institutional_ownership from the response
institutional_ownership = response.json().get('institutional_ownership')
```

### ðŸ’»  Example (with report_period)

```python Institutional Ownership
import requests

# add your API key to the headers
headers = {
    "X-API-KEY": "your_api_key_here"
}

# set your query params
ticker = 'NVDA'     
limit = 100      
report_period_lte = '2024-01-01' # end date
report_period_gte = '2020-01-01' # start date

# create the URL
url = (
    f'https://api.financialdatasets.ai/institutional-ownership'
    f'?ticker={ticker}'
    f'&limit={limit}'
    f'&report_period_lte={report_period_lte}'
    f'&report_period_gte={report_period_gte}'
)

# make API request
response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)

# parse institutional_ownership from the response
institutional_ownership = response.json().get('institutional_ownership')
```
