### ðŸ‘‹  Overview
We have SEC filings for <b>10,000+</b> public companies.

Any data that you receive from our API is yours to keep. You may save the data to minimize repeat API calls.

To get started, please create an account and grab your <b>API key</b> at [financialdatasets.ai](https://financialdatasets.ai).

You will use the API key to authenticate your API requests.

### ðŸ“Š Available Tickers
You can fetch a list of available tickers with a `GET` request to:
https://api.financialdatasets.ai/filings/tickers/

###  ðŸš€  Getting Started
There are only 3 steps for making a successful API call:
1. Add your API key to the header of the request as `X-API-KEY`.
2. Add query params like `ticker` to filter the data.
3. Execute the API request.

**Note**: You must include either the `ticker` in your query params.

### ðŸ’»  Example

```python Filings
import requests

# add your API key to the headers
headers = {
    "X-API-KEY": "your_api_key_here"
}

# set your query params
ticker = 'AAPL'

# create the URL
url = (
    f'https://api.financialdatasets.ai/filings'
    f'?ticker={ticker}'
)

# make API request
response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)

# parse filings from the response
filings = response.json().get('filings')
```
