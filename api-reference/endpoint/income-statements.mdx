### ðŸ‘‹  Overview
We have income statements for <b>16,000+</b> public companies, going back <b>30+</b> years.

Any income statements that you receive from our API is yours to keep. You may save the data to minimize repeat API calls.

To get started, please create an account and can get your <b>API key</b> at [financialdatasets.ai](https://financialdatasets.ai).

You will use the API key to authenticate your API requests.

###  ðŸš€  Getting Started
There are two steps to make a successful API call:
1. Add your API key to the header of the request as `X-API-KEY`.
2. Add query params like `ticker`, `period` and `limit` to filter the data.

**Note**: `ticker` and `period` are required.  By default, `limit` is `10`.

### ðŸ’»  Example

```python Income Statements
import requests

# add your API key to the headers
headers = {
    "X-API-KEY": "your_api_key_here"
}

# set your query params
ticker = 'NVDA'     # stock ticker
period = 'annual'   # possible values are 'annual', 'quarterly', or 'ttm'
limit = 30          # number of statements to return

# create the URL
url = (
    f'https://api.financialdatasets.ai/financials/income-statements'
    f'?ticker={ticker}'
    f'&period={period}'
    f'&limit={limit}'
)

# make API request
response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)

# parse income_statements from the response
income_statements = response.json().get('income_statements')
```
