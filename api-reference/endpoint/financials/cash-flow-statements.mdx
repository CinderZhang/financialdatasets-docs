### ðŸ‘‹  Overview
We have cash flow statements for <b>16,000+</b> public companies, going back <b>30+</b> years.

Any cash flow statements that you receive from our API is yours to keep. You may save the data to minimize repeat API calls.

To get started, please create an account and grab your <b>API key</b> at [financialdatasets.ai](https://financialdatasets.ai).

You will use the API key to authenticate your API requests.

###  ðŸš€  Getting Started
There are only 3 steps for making a successful API call:
1. Add your API key to the header of the request as `X-API-KEY`.
2. Add query params like `ticker`, `period` and `limit` to filter the data.
3. Execute the API request.

**Note**: `ticker` and `period` are required.  By default, `limit` is `10`.

### ðŸ’»  Example

```python Cash Flow Statements
import requests

# add your API key to the headers
headers = {
    "X-API-KEY": "your_api_key_here"
}

# set your query params
ticker = 'NVDA'     # stock ticker
period = 'annual'   # possible values are 'annual', 'quarterly', or 'ttm'
limit = 30          # number of statements to return

# create the URL
url = (
    f'https://api.financialdatasets.ai/financials/cash-flow-statements'
    f'?ticker={ticker}'
    f'&period={period}'
    f'&limit={limit}'
)

# make API request
response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)

# parse cash_flow_statements from the response
cash_flow_statements = response.json().get('cash_flow_statements')
```
