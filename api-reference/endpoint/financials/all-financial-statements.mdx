title: 'All Financial Statements'
openapi: 'GET /financials'
---

### ðŸ‘‹  Overview
This endpoint aggregates all financial statements for a ticker into a single API call.

So, instead of calling 3 endpoints to get income statements, balance sheets, and cash flow statements, you can call this endpoint once and get all financial statements in one go.

The endpoint returns the following financial statements:
- [Income Statements](/api-reference/endpoint/financials/income-statements)
- [Balance Sheets](/api-reference/endpoint/financials/balance-sheets)
- [Cash Flow Statements](/api-reference/endpoint/financials/cash-flow-statements)

Any data that you receive from our API is yours to keep. You may save the data to minimize repeat API calls.

To get started, please create an account and grab your <b>API key</b> at [financialdatasets.ai](https://financialdatasets.ai).

You will use the API key to authenticate your API requests.

###  ðŸš€  Getting Started
There are only 3 steps for making a successful API call:
1. Add your API key to the header of the request as `X-API-KEY`.
2. Add query params like `ticker`, `period` and `limit` to filter the data.
3. Execute the API request.

**Note**: `ticker` and `period` are required. Alternatively, you can use `cik` instead of `ticker` as a company identifier in your request.  By default, `limit` is `10`.

### ðŸ’»  Example

```python All Financial Statements
import requests

# add your API key to the headers
headers = {
    "X-API-KEY": "your_api_key_here"
}

# set your query params
ticker = 'NVDA'     # stock ticker
period = 'annual'   # possible values are 'annual', 'quarterly', or 'ttm'
limit = 30          # number of statements to return

# create the URL
url = (
    f'https://api.financialdatasets.ai/financials/'
    f'?ticker={ticker}'
    f'&period={period}'
    f'&limit={limit}'
)

# make API request
response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)

# parse financials from the response
financials = response.json().get('financials')

# get income statements
income_statements = financials.get('income_statements')

# get balance sheets
balance_sheets = financials.get('balance_sheets')

# get cash flow statements
cash_flow_statements = financials.get('cash_flow_statements')
```
