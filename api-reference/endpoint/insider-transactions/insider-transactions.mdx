title: 'Insider Transactions'
openapi: 'GET /insider-transactions'

### ðŸ‘‹  Overview
The insider transactions API lets you access the stock buys and sales of public company insiders like CEOs, CFOs, and Directors.

We have insider transactions for <b>15,000+</b> public companies, going back <b>10+</b> years.

In addition to the stock buys and sales, you can also access the current ownership stakes of insiders.

This data is useful for understanding the sentiment of company insiders. For example, you can answer questions like:
- How many shares of Nvidia does Jensen Huang own?
- How many shares of Microsoft did Satya Nadella buy last quarter?
- How many shares of Apple has Tim Cook sold over the past year?

Any data that you receive from our API is yours to keep. You may save the data to minimize repeat API calls.

To get started, please create an account and grab your <b>API key</b> at [financialdatasets.ai](https://financialdatasets.ai).

You will use the API key to authenticate your API requests.

###  ðŸš€  Getting Started
There are only 3 steps for making a successful API call:
1. Add your API key to the header of the request as `X-API-KEY`.
2. Add query params like `ticker` and `limit` to filter the data.
3. Execute the API request.

**Note**: `ticker` is required required.  By default, `limit` is `100`.

### ðŸ’»  Example

```python Insider Transactions
import requests

# add your API key to the headers
headers = {
    "X-API-KEY": "your_api_key_here"
}

# set your query params
ticker = 'NVDA'     # stock ticker
limit = 100         # number of transactions to return

# create the URL
url = (
    f'https://api.financialdatasets.ai/insider-transactions'
    f'?ticker={ticker}'
    f'&limit={limit}'
)

# make API request
response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)

# parse insider_transactions from the response
insider_transactions = response.json().get('insider_transactions')
```
