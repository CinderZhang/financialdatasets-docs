title: 'Search (by line items)'

openapi: 'POST /financials/search/line-items'
---

### ðŸ‘‹  Overview
This endpoint lets you search for <b>specific</b> financial metrics by specifying a set of `line_items` in your request.

You can search by any line item that is listed below in the [Line Items](#line-items) section.

For example, you can search for `net_income` and `total_debt` for NVDA and AAPL and receive the following response:

```json
{
  "search_results": [
    {
      "ticker": "NVDA",
      "report_period": "2024-07-28",
      "period": "ttm",
      "net_income": 53008000000,
      "total_debt": 9765000000
    },
    {
      "ticker": "AAPL",
      "report_period": "2024-06-29",
      "period": "ttm",
      "net_income": 101956000000,
      "total_debt": 101304000000
    }
  ]
}
```

To get started, please create an account and grab your <b>API key</b> at [financialdatasets.ai](https://financialdatasets.ai).

You will use the API key to authenticate your API requests.

The Financials Search API lets you search for financial data across income statements, balance sheets,
and cash flow statements for <b>16,000+</b> public companies, going back <b>30+</b> years.

###  ðŸš€  Getting Started
There are 3 steps for making a successful API call:
1. Add your API key to the header of the request as `X-API-KEY`.
2. Prepare a JSON body with your search criteria, including `tickers`, `line_items`, `period`, and `limit`.
3. Execute the API request to the /financials/search endpoint using a POST method.

The `period` can be one of `"ttm"` (trailing twelve months), `"annual"`, or `"quarterly"`.

The `limit` is the maximum number of data points to return per ticker.  For example, if you have 2 tickers and set the limit to 3, you will get 6 data points in total, 3 per ticker.

Note: `tickers` and `line_items` are required. By default, `period` is `"ttm"` and `limit` is 1.

### ðŸ”Ž  Line Items
This endpoint lets you request data for specific `line_items` for a list of tickers.

You may specify multiple `line_items` to narrow down the search results.

You can also mix-and-match `line_items` from different financial statements. For example, you can search for `net_income` from the income statement and `total_debt` from the balance sheet.

Each line item consists of a key. The key is the name of the financial metric that you want to search for.

We charge \$0.01 per 10 line items per search. For example, 5 line items costs \$0.01, 15 line items costs \$0.02, and so on.
